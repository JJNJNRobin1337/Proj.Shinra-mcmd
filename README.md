Minecraft Mod that combines Industrial/Technology and Magic together (1.18.2]

i dont know what to fill this with, i guess just filler?

something, something. three seperate tech tree types are intended (the magic tree, technology tree, and magitech tree]; each one written differently
machine skins are also an idea i was thinking of; incase people wanted to make more exotic builds, or wanted more specific styles (whether the machine changes size from this is undecided but unlikely]

pollution is absolutely planned to be included in this mod, likely in each layer (magic pollution and industrial pollution - a combination of both is likely possible but i have no ideas for such yet]
pollution management will be included alongside this, of course; alongside a seperation between 'interior pollution' and 'chunk pollution' (though i dont know how fluid pollution would be handled; especially once it hits oceans]
