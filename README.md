# Crystallum-Technologia
Minecraft Mod that combines Industrial/Technology and Magic together (1.20.1]

Short-explanation explains it all. Its a minecraft mod that intends to combine technology and magic in a neat enough way.
Specifically, its Crystalline Magic; where in that there are Diodes, Vacuum tubes, ect, made using a form of magic crystal; as a method to achieve such.
Some machines lean more magic, some more tech, depending on the task. Some are entirely such, due to the lack of the other at the region in its tech tree.

This will have several components seperated as addons. Nether Overhaul, Villager Overhaul, Pillager Overhaul, Temple Overhaul, Pollution System, and potentially others, may be seperated into other mods.

Tech Tree will be accessed by a book, but to research, you need an equivelant station. Knowledge transfer between players is also achievable, alongside "reverse engineering" as a special method without permission.

Sabotage may be conceptualized as a potential system.

Current thoughts of tech tree:
1. Start with basic machines.
2. Discovery and first experimentations with Magic.
3. Early Magic-Technology, additional experimentation.
4. More advanced Magitech, maybe nether tech (not including addon).

Addons include:
Piglin Overhaul (inspired by Minecraft Legends]
Villager Overhaul (including villages]
Pillager Overhaul (inspired in part by Minecraft Legends and Minecraft Dungeons]
Pollution Compatability (compatability mod for a custom pollution system, seperate from pollution of the realms]
Hypothetical 'Workers and Unions Expansion' (requires all three overhauls]
Golems and Robots Pack (partially legends inspired, will have a 'sub-expansion' which might require the same mods as the Workers and Unions expansion, due to including Villager, Piglin, and Pillager 'Golems']
