basic progression, obviously
heres the idea: making the technology and magic seperately, before advancing both enough to combine into one machine of that type
(vacuum tubes werent originally for computers after all]

magic side: early magic stuff (smelting? mana? dont know]

technology side: early tech stuff (smelting? press? differences between steam and electrical stuff?]

magitech side: (to be decided after enough work on magic and technology]

pollution: (planned, and im still curious on the idea of differences between magic and industrial pollutions; yet how they can still combine, like normal
counterparts can still combine]
